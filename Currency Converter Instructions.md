Currency Converter Instructions

Create a currency converter console app.

The app should have a menu.  
Include 5 conversions on the menu and an exit option.  
Loop the program so that the user can convert until they are finished. 

The app should display confirmation messages and conversion totals.

Example:

Dollars:  $100.00   converts to 79.40 pounds

or something similar.
